IOS IS SHITE

state is not being read/write to localstorage.
state is not pre-filled on refresh, on iOS.
 -- write to opfs first, if fail, catch and write to localStorage.
 -- read from opfs first, if not possible read from localStorage, if local Key is nil, reset! to defautl maps.


Hypothesis 0 - opfs.createWritbale doesn't return an exception as GPT said it would.
Hypothsesis 1 - opfs.getFile doesn't return an exception on iOS. which leads to the read function not falling back to local storage.


-- log errors in DOM.
